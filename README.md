The code for this project was developed with significant guidance from the course materials, including in-class lectures, recorded Zoom sessions, and direct assistance from the instructor during office hours.

Throughout the development process, I followed the detailed instructions and rubric provided for the assignment. The structure of the code and most of the logic stem from the course's instructional content. In particular, I referenced the lecture examples and the material covered during office hours to troubleshoot and refine my code.

When I encountered an error, I sought help from the instructor during office hours, where they assisted me in identifying the issue and providing guidance on how to resolve it. While the code was developed by me, it closely follows the examples and guidance provided during these sessions.

I want to acknowledge that the majority of the codeâ€™s structure and logic comes from the in-class materials and the support I received from the instructor, and I followed the rubric carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy throughout my submission.
